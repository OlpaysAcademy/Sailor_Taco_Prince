This repository is only for educational purpose, it is not intended to work in any real way 
```

This exercise consists of an application that can:
* Create taco recipes
* Add ingredients to tacos
* List taco recipes names and indicate next to them whether they are read or unread
* Show a count of number of read taco recipes
* Be able to mark every taco recipe as read or unread
* Be able to mark as read or unread in the taco detail view

Requirements:
* Everything should be in a single page (no routes). There should be a sidenav that lists taco recipes

```
